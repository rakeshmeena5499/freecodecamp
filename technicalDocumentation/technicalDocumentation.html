			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
				<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </li>
				<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
				<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

		<header>JavaScript and Java</header>
		<article>
			<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. </p>
			<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed. </p>

		<header>Hello World</header>
		<article>
			<p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
			<code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>
				greetMe("World");</code>
			<p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="variables">
		<header>Variables</header>
		<article>
			<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
			<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
		<header>Declaring Variables</header>
		<article>
			<p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
			<p>With the keyword var. For example, </p>
			<code>var x = 42</code>
			<p>By simply assigning it a value. For example, </p>
			<code>x=5</code>
			<p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
			<p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
			<code>let y = 13</code>
			<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
		</article>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
		<header>Variable Scope</header>
		<article>
			<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
			<code>if (true) { <br>var x = 5;<br> }<br> console.log(x); // 5</code>
			<p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
			<code>if (true) {<br> let y = 5;<br> }<br> console.log(y);</code>
			<p> Here ReferenceError y is not defined</p>
		</article>

	<section class="main-section" id="global_variable">
		<header>Global Variable</header>
		<article>
			<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.<br>
			Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
		</article>

	<section class="main-section" id="data_types">
		<header>Data Types</header>
		<article>
			<p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines six data types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
				<li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
				<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
				<li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
				<li>String. "Howdy"</li>
				<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
		<header>Fucntion Declaration</header>
		<article>
			<p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The name of the function.</li>
				<li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
				<li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
			<code>function square(number) {<br> return number * number;<br> }</code>
			<p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function. </p>
